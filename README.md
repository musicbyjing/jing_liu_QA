I picked Selenium for the following reasons:

- It's versatile language-wise--since the team works in Python and JS and Selenium has implementations in both languages (among many others), they could use either
    - From my experience with Selenium in Java, and learning it in JS for this, I think they purposefully kept the implementations pretty consistent. So Python devs wouldn't need much time to be capable of understanding tests written in JS, and vice versa.
- There's cross browser (and cross-platform) support. I can write a test and run it in different browsers by changing a couple LOCs
